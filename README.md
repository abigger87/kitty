A **lightweight**, **extensible** [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) library for shell scripting.


## What?

**unix** is an extensible wrapper for common unix shell commands. It provides a minimal api for executing expressive shell commands from inside Solidity using [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)'s [fii](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/ffi.html).


## Installation

```
forge install abigger87/unix
```

## Usage

_NOTE: You must enable [ffi](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/ffi.html) in order to use this library. You can either pass the `--ffi` flag to any forge commands you run (e.g. `forge script Script --ffi`), or you can add `ffi = true` to your `foundry.toml` file._

_NOTE: **unix** assumes you are running on a UNIX based machine with `bash`, `tail`, `sed`, `tr`, `curl` and `cast` installed._


1. Add this import to your script or test:
```solidity
import {Unix} from "unix/Unix.sol";
```

2. Add this directive inside of your Contract:
```solidity
using Unix for *;
```

3. Run your shell commands. This can be done in two ways:

a) Using strong typing **(recommended)**:
```solidity
// Echo "Hello World"
(uint256 status, bytes memory data) = Unix.echo().stdout("Hello World").run();

// Pipe file contents to another file
// NOTE: Commands can be instantiated from a text string using `Command.from(<YOUR_STRING>)` _(see grep command below)_
(uint256 status, bytes memory data) = Unix.cat().file("README.md").pipe(Command.from("grep \"Hello\")).run();
```

b) Using raw string commands.
```solidity
// Cat a file
(uint256 status, bytes memory data) = "cat README.md".run();
// string(data) == <contents of README.md>

// Echo a string
(uint256 status, bytes memory data) = "echo Hello World".run();
// string(data) == "Hello World"

// Print the working directory
(uint256 status, bytes memory data) = "pwd".run();
// string(data) == <working directory>
```

We have provided extensive examples in [scripts](./script/) and further completeness is demonstrated in [tests](./test/Unix.t.sol).

To run scripts, simply prefix the script name with `forge s` like so: `forge s <script_name>`. For example, to run the [echo](./script/echo.s.sol) script, run: `forge s echo`.


## Contributing

_NOTE: This library is built using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). To learn more about foundry and its usage, please refer to [foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)._

All contributions are welcome! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
  - Reporting a bug
  - Discussing the current state of the code
  - Submitting a fix
  - Proposing new features
  - Becoming a maintainer

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/abigger87/unix/issues/new); it's that easy!

To run tests, install and update modules with `forge update` and run `forge test` to run all tests!
